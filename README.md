RAISR: Rapid and Accurate Image Super Resolution 
# Introduction
I find a terrible mistake here, they will be repaired soon.

This code is aim to achieve the single image super-resolution algorithm established by this particle:
RAISR: Rapid and Accurate Image Super Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01299v3.pdf).

It's just a test now and could only deal with grey-scale image.

I used it to deal with the CT image, the best part is that it trainning and running really fast( the whole filter may not be necessary for special questions).

I can't put the test image here for secrety reason, and i'll put on a normal edition letter. 

I will complete the CT-Blending part in the future.
